This bundle lazy loads models from /bundle/Model folder

models have to be defined in /bundle/Resources/config/models.yml file:
---------------- models.yml ----------------
modelName:
	model/namespace/modelName
--------------------------------------------

Other configuration files might be coming sometime later as well as
configurations for custom models locations
